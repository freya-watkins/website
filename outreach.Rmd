* In May 2017 our lab held a stall at [Deaffest](https://deaffest.co.uk/) in Wolverhampton, the largest Deaf arts festival in the UK. Visitors were able to learn about our recent research findings, have a go at some of our psycholinguistic experiments on BSL and find out how to participate in upcoming studies.

* Our research on the relationship between sign production and sign comprehension was featured in a [press release on the University of Birmingham website](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2017/05/sign-language-comprehension.aspx).
