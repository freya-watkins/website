* In May 2017 our lab held a stall at [Deaffest](https://deaffest.co.uk/) in Wolverhampton, the largest Deaf arts festival in the UK. Visitors were able to learn about our recent research findings, have a go at some of our psycholinguistic experiments on BSL and find out how to participate in upcoming studies.

* Our research on the relationship between sign production and sign comprehension was featured in a [press release on the University of Birmingham website](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2017/05/sign-language-comprehension.aspx).

* In January 2017 I was interviewed by [BBC See Hear](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08h4rzg) regarding my [open letter](https://www.facebook.com/raeumeraeumen/posts/10158255324655727) calling for a halt to the deportation of a deaf child refugee from Iraq, due to the risk to his language acquisition and mental health.
