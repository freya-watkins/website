#Biography
I previously studied German & Linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, where I developed an interest in British Sign Language and sign language linguistics. 

In my second year I became of SignSoc, the student sign language society at Edinburgh. In the summer I undertook a research internship at the [Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dcal) at UCL with Dr Robin Thompson.

On my year abroad, I studied German Sign Language (DGS) in Hamburg & Tubingen and on my return wrote my MA dissertation on auditory attention and visuospatial cognition in bimodal bilinguals, supervised by [Prof Antonella Sorace](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/antonella-sorace) and [Dr Thomas Bak](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/thomas-bak).

After graduating I returned to Germany, where I continued to learn DGS while working as a German translator, before receiving 1+3 ESRC funding for a MSc and PhD with Dr Robin Thompson at the University of Birmingham.
